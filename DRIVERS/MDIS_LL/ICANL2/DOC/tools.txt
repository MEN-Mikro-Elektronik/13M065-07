icanl2_simp      - ICANL2 simple example for M065/P5
icanl2_cyc       - ICANL2 cycle timer example for M065/P5
icanl2_signal    - ICANL2 simple example for M065/P5

Program icanl2_simp
-------------------

Usage:
   icanl2_simp <device> <chan>

Function:
   ICANL2 simple example for M065/P5

Options:
   device       device name   
   
Description:
   Simple example program for the ICANL2 driver   
   
   - Configures CAN chip for 1MBps, basic (11 bit) CAN mode   
   - Creates a general message fifo to store all incoming   
   CAN messages   
   - Creates one Tx object with ID 0x123 and sends a single   
   frame with that ID   
   - Waits for events on CAN bus. Any incoming event and CAN   
   message is printed to stdout   
   - Exits when more than 100 events received   
   
Program icanl2_cyc
------------------

Usage:
   icanl2_cyc <device> <chan>

Function:
   ICANL2 cycle timer example for M065/P5

Options:
   device       device name   
   
Description:
   Example program for the ICANL2 driver: cyclic transmissions   
   
   - Configures CAN chip for 1MBps, basic (11 bit) CAN mode   
   - Creates some Tx objects   
   - Start to transmit these Tx objects cyclically   
   - Waits 5s   
   - disables CAN   
   
Program icanl2_signal
---------------------

Usage:
   icanl2_signal <device> <chan>

Function:
   ICANL2 simple example for M065/P5

Options:
   device       device name   
   
Description:
   Simple example program for using the ICANL2 driver with signals   
   
   - Configures CAN chip for 1MBps, basic (11 bit) CAN mode   
   - Creates a general message fifo to store all incoming   
   CAN messages   
   - Creates one Tx object with ID 0x123 and sends a single   
   frame with that ID   
   - Installs signal handler and configures driver to generate   
   signal at every event.   
   - Waits for events on CAN bus. Any incoming event and CAN   
   message is printed to stdout   
   - Exits when more than 100 events received
